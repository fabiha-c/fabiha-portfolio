          <h3>UN SDG's to Social Innovation course- Hanyang University</h3>
          <p>I completed a 3 week course in Seoul, South Korea which I learned about the UN Sustainable Development Goals and social innovation. The program combined theoretical knowledge with practical applications through case studies, field trips, and a group project in which a sustainable social entrepreneurship model had to be developed to address a citywide social issue of our choosing. The case studies involved issues in South Korea, as well as issues in other countries to bring different perspectives to coming up with sustainable solutions.</p>
          <p>This course provided a strong focus on all the SDGs, but I felt that there was an emphasis on SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals. This course taught me how to delve deeper into the key indicators for the SDGs and what it meant to come up with a truly sustainable solution. One key indicator of SDG 17 is to "enhance policy coherence for sustainable development" which is something this course was able to achieve in an educational context. This course also related to SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure as several lectures focused on how sustainable and reliable infrastructure was developed in South Korea, as well as how other countries in Africa and Asia have taken different creative approaches. This course placed a focus on creative strategic thinking and how to train conscious empathy to inspire new solutions for social issues. Additionally, the course emphasized system thinking and root cause analysis to determine the most effective way in addressing a social issue while coming up with a sustainable solution.</p>
          <p>This course was an enlightening and fun experience that allowed me to be culturally immersed in South Korea and learn more about how to develop sustainable solutions with creative approaches. This learning experience will definitely be useful as I begin to write my Bachelor's Thesis this year with a focus on SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being. I was inspired by Dr. Kim's lectures and case studies try to think outside the box for sustainable solutions, and consider how to achieve a "circular economy" when addressing issues so that the solutions remain sustainable. As someone who would like to go into the healthcare field in the future, the field trip and guest lectures we attended were also inspiring and brought me fresh unique perspectives on how I may want to address social issues in dentistry in the future. Overall, I felt that this course guided my professional, academic, and personal development by allowing me to fully understand the thought process behind finding social issues to address and coming up with a range of solutions that would be sustainable in the long run.</p>

          <p>This VIP directly relates to SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure as well as SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities. One of the indicators for having accomplished SDG 9 is to develop reliable and sustainable infrastructure that has a focus on affordable and equitable access. By working with the EAT VIP on sensory events throughout the semester, I have learned a lot from research and listening to others' perspectives on how to create low sensory spaces at Tandon. Our team held a sensory event where people could come in to make stress balls, and everything was carefully coordinated for the event to prevent anything from being overstimulating. I was in charge of marketing for this event, so I had to do research on specific colorways to use for posters, as well as how to determine whether all the text elements on a poster were accessible for all. I had the opportunity to visit a poetry night at the Guggenheim museum as an event referred to me by the EAT VIP, which was a significant learning experience for me to determine how to approach SDG 10. As one of the indicators of completing this SDG is the empowerment and promotion of social, economic and political inclusion of all, I felt that this event gave me a fresh perspective on art and how different components such as body grammar and forms of language can be used for expression.</p>
          <p>Being a member of this VIP was a significant learning experience for me professionally, academically, and personally. In terms of my professional goals, I feel that all of the people I met through this VIP as well as all the research I had done to prepare for the sensory event my team planned at NYU have inspired me to think further about how to create more accessible spaces in dental clinics in the future. Furthermore, I learned a lot about verbal and body language that contributes to an accessible professional setting. Academically, I realized that there is a lot that I can do as a student to continue working on creating inclusive spaces and events, and that even the smallest attention to detail will go a long way. As an academic goal, I would like to further research how to improve accessibility at Tandon in any sense that I can while trying to take advantage of my Biomolecular Science major as well. Personally, I felt inspired to take on poetry and look into more creative outlets after visiting the Poetry Night at the Guggenheim museum where so many artists were able to express themselves through words, sign language, or body language. I would like to tap into creative outlets more and determine how to make everything I do be more accessible to others.</p>
