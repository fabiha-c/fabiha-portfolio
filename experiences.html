              <p>During my study abroad experience at NYU Abu Dhabi, I immersed myself in a unique educational environment engaging with students from over 200 nationalities. I explored diverse perspectives in education and lifestyles, participated in various club activities, and connected with peers from different cultural backgrounds. This experience taught me how to navigate life independently in a foreign country and allowed me to embrace my cultural identity as a Muslim American more fully.</p>
              <p>The impact was profound—academically, I learned to adapt to a new learning environment, and personally, I gained confidence in my ability to communicate and connect with people from different backgrounds. This directly relates to my mission of becoming a global leader capable of making a positive impact across diverse cultures.</p>

              <p>I participated in the three-week HUMAN'INSA program combining technical and cultural education. The AI track taught me Python for generating simple AI models, while the French Language and Cross-Cultural Communication track allowed me to immerse myself in French culture. As a Biomolecular Science major with basic Python knowledge, the AI track was particularly challenging and rewarding.</p>
              <p>I significantly improved my proficiency in Python—a skill increasingly important in research as AI becomes more integrated into scientific work. Personally, I overcame challenges like navigating French cuisine with dietary restrictions and language barriers, boosting my confidence in adapting to new environments.</p>

              <p>I completed a 3-week course in Seoul learning about UN Sustainable Development Goals and social innovation. The program combined theoretical knowledge with practical applications through case studies, field trips, and a group project developing a sustainable social entrepreneurship model to address a citywide social issue.</p>
              <p>This course emphasized SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) and SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure). I learned to delve deeper into key indicators for the SDGs and understand what it means to develop truly sustainable solutions. The focus on creative strategic thinking and system thinking to determine the most effective way to address social issues will be invaluable as I write my reflective research paper focusing on SDG 3.</p>

              <p>I participated in the 6-week Waseda Summer Session in Tokyo, taking courses in Japanese Business Management and Disability Studies in Japan. As someone pursuing a minor in Public Policy and Management, the management course taught me valuable lessons on cross-cultural communication, marketing, and comparisons of Western vs. Japanese work cultures.</p>
              <p>The Disability Studies class involved field work assignments assessing Japan's infrastructure for accessibility. I examined alleys, convenience stores, train stations, and more to determine how Japan accommodates those with disabilities. This connected to SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), strengthening my resolve for starting my own dental clinic in the future while learning about leadership and effective healthcare management without compromising on accessibility.</p>

              <p>At the Jha Lab within NYU Abu Dhabi's Genetic Heritage Group, I focused on isolating bacteria from saliva samples and fermented foods. My responsibilities included practicing DNA extractions, conducting microscopy, collecting and preserving samples, and analyzing growth and inhibition patterns through cross cultures. I also honed my data analysis skills using R programming.</p>
              <p>This experience developed practical lab skills I can apply to future research projects, including preparing media, operating lab equipment like autoclaves, and performing bacterial isolation and culture techniques. These skills enhanced my understanding of how different bacterial strains interact and influence health outcomes, particularly relevant to oral-systemic health connections.</p>

              <p>I joined this VIP to understand how I can contribute to creating more accessible spaces as someone who wants to manage a dental clinic. Through weekly team meetings discussing low sensory spaces at Tandon and meeting with the Director of the Oral Health Center for People with Disabilities at NYU Dentistry, I learned about design and language decisions that uphold accessible environments.</p>
              <p>This VIP relates to SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities). I was in charge of marketing for a sensory event, researching specific colorways and accessible text elements. I also visited a poetry night at the Guggenheim museum focusing on body grammar and forms of language for expression. All the people I met through this VIP inspired me to think further about creating accessible spaces in dental clinics.</p>

This role exposed me to the realities of dental care delivery in low-income communities and the systemic challenges patients face in accessing restorative care.</p>
              <p>This experience directly informed my understanding of oral health inequity and treatment decision-making patterns. I observed how resource constraints and time pressures influence clinical choices, contributing to my research focus on workforce training and equitable care delivery.</p>
