              <p>During my two-week Alternative Break Service Trip in Galle, Sri Lanka, I shadowed professionals in the maxillofacial surgery wing of Karapitiya Teaching Hospital. I observed surgeries, learned about alternative treatments at an Ayurvedic hospital, and volunteered at a turtle hatchery contributing to marine conservation. I also visited an elderly home where I overcame language barriers to guide residents through exercises and crafts.</p>
              <p>I gained valuable exposure to maxillofacial surgeries that expanded my understanding of dental practice in different parts of the world. Observing how healthcare providers navigate challenges with limited resources deepened my appreciation for resourcefulness and adaptability. At the turtle hatchery, I learned to gut fish by hand—stepping outside my comfort zone to help baby turtles in a vulnerable population.</p>

              <h3>GLASS x Prehealth Service Trip — Nairobi, Kenya</h3>
              <p>I participated in a 2-week Alternative Break Service Trip in Nairobi, Kenya. I shadowed at a local government hospital in Tigoni and helped design and paint a mural for a children's home. I found myself managing teams and coordinating with others in the dental clinic to find new solutions when faced with limited resources.</p>
              <p>I learned about healthcare management in Kenya and how faculty members keep operations running smoothly with limited resources. I was trained to perform an extraction—my first direct clinical exposure beyond suctioning. This experience motivated me to look for dental school opportunities more focused on practice, representing a shift in my academic journey.</p>

          <h2>Writing Partner Experience</h2>
        </div>

        <p>As a writing tutor for Tandon students, particularly international students who faced challenges with English, I dedicated my time to supporting and enhancing their writing skills. My role involved meeting with the same six students weekly throughout the semester, guiding them through writing assignments, teaching effective techniques, and helping them set and work towards personal writing goals.</p>
        
        <p>My motivation stemmed from a belief in the power of communication as a cornerstone of education and personal development. I recognized that by assisting students in improving their writing, I was not only helping them academically but also empowering them to express themselves more confidently in a new linguistic and cultural environment.</p>
        
        <p>The impact was multifaceted. Academically, it allowed me to reinforce my own understanding of effective communication while learning to adapt teaching methods to individual needs. I would hold sessions around 45 minutes to an hour, and because of the limited time, I had to ensure they were getting the most out of each session. I also wrote reports summarizing our sessions and reiterating advice provided.</p>
        
        <p>This role allowed me to become more comfortable with teaching and thinking about new ways to make seemingly difficult subjects seem more simple and interesting. I made an effort to make my students comfortable and ensure that the activities I assigned helped them in the long term. This also gave me practice explaining concepts and writing techniques effectively, and realizing common patterns and errors in writing that I may have made in the past myself.</p>

        <p>This experience directly relates to my mission of advocating for equitable healthcare and dental care. Effective communication is vital in healthcare settings, and by improving language skills, I'm contributing to a more inclusive and accessible healthcare environment. By empowering students with enhanced communication skills, I'm helping to cultivate a more diverse, informed, and articulate community essential for driving forward changes in the healthcare system.</p>

          <h2>Leading Research Teams</h2>
        </div>

        <p>One of my most meaningful leadership experiences was towards the end of my semester abroad in Abu Dhabi, when I was tasked with performing mixed cultures to reflect my learning and training from the lab. I was initially assigned to work with another student, but she left the lab shortly after, so I assumed the sole leadership role on creating combinations to submit to the lab for evaluation.</p>
        
        <p>My mentor asked me to train two new PhD students who would officially begin working in the lab over the summer. Despite being an undergraduate, she trusted me to show them best practices for making different kinds of media, handling logistics like requesting items from the lab store, and coordinating with other research labs to use community biological cabinets and the autoclave.</p>
        
        <p>As an undergraduate research assistant, I recognized my limitations in knowledge compared to the PhD students, but I put my best foot forward and prided myself in using proper techniques. There were several days where I spent mornings in classes and stayed in the lab from early afternoon to late evening while balancing PhD student training and my subculturing project.</p>
        
        <p>This experience not only strengthened my scientific and technical skills but also reinforced my leadership style in execution—ensuring I got everything done efficiently and effectively. I was able to lead without a title and bridge knowledge gaps between the PhD students and myself. I focused the first few days on explaining my process and why each step was significant, providing specific guidelines. After several days of training, they assisted me in creating media to plate the cross cultures.</p>
        
        <p>My experience taught me that leadership is not about a title or officially assumed role, but rather about stepping forward and bringing harmony to a project while communicating effectively with others. I learned more about my own leadership style—I thrive best in decision making and executing tasks on my own, while also optimizing time by allocating separate tasks while assessing my team's respective areas of expertise.</p>
