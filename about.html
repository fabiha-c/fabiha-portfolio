          <p>My journey has always been intertwined with a deep-seated passion for healthcare and a relentless pursuit of knowledge and change. As a sophomore, I've navigated through the intricate maze of academia and personal growth with a profound interest in healthcare, despite facing challenges in excelling in the very subjects that form its foundation. The trials I encountered in understanding complex biological processes and healthcare policies did not weaken my resolve but rather fueled my passion to bring about change in the healthcare field. This propelled me to seek opportunities beyond the traditional classroom setting, embarking on a quest for knowledge, reaching out to professionals in the field, and exploring various healthcare domains through extensive research. My drive for understanding and improvement, even when faced with academic adversities, is a testament to my character and unwavering determination.


In my pursuit, I've realized that healthcare is not just a field of study but a complex, interconnected world requiring a multifaceted approach. I've learned that to truly make an impact, one must understand it from various angles – from the microscopic details of biomedical research to the broader implications of policy and management. My experiences, both in and out of the classroom, have significantly contributed to shaping my vision. I not only aspire to excel academically but also seek to understand and influence the many aspects of healthcare. The GLASS program represents a pivotal opportunity in this journey, offering me the chance to develop as a leader, researcher, and informed global citizen. I am eager to dive into this program, to explore new perspectives, collaborate with like-minded peers, and further my research, all while being guided by a goal to improve health and well-being on a global scale.


In my free time, I like to learn new languages through media exposure- whether it be through reading, watching TV shows/movies, or listening to music. I am currently learning Arabic, but have also been passively sharpening my skills in Korean and French.  This approach allows me to naturally improve my listening and comprehension skills while also gaining insight into diverse perspectives and artistic expressions. Beyond language learning, I have a deep appreciation for creative expression. I enjoy writing, using it as a way to reflect on my experiences, explore different perspectives, and articulate my thoughts in meaningful ways. Additionally, I am currently learning pottery, which has been an exciting hands-on experience that allows me to blend artistry with craftsmanship. Whether through words or clay, I find fulfillment in creating and expressing myself in different forms. Exploring languages, writing, and pottery has enriched my understanding of culture, storytelling, and the beauty of handcrafted work.


As I look toward the future, I see my path as one of continuous growth and significant contribution. I am committed to not only pursuing personal academic success but also to making a substantial impact in the world of healthcare. My ambition is to be at the forefront of innovative solutions, addressing complex health issues, and contributing to a future where quality healthcare is accessible and effective for all. My journey is one of relentless pursuit, a testament to my commitment to not just change, but meaningful and impactful progress. With every step, I aim to draw closer to a world where healthcare is not just a privilege but a right available to every individual, regardless of their background or circumstances.</p>

        <h2>Program Impact</h2>
        <p>Being in GLASS has profoundly impacted me, offering a multitude of opportunities and fostering productive discussions that have significantly enhanced my academic and professional journey. From the very beginning, I was given the opportunity to connect with upperclassmen and gain insights into optimizing my study abroad experience and academic journey at Tandon. This advice was particularly beneficial as I navigated the unfamiliar territory of studying outside New York City. Additionally, the focus on CliftonStrengths has been transformative, enabling me to recognize and harness my strengths effectively while also being mindful of their limitations. Engaging with professionals like Andrew Parr and Jolie Woodson during seminars further enriched my understanding of setting SMART(ER) goals and advancing professionally, guiding me toward finding a potential summer internship that aligns perfectly with my aspirations in dental research. 


GLASS has particularly honed my understanding of my personal strengths, encouraging deep self-reflection and enabling me to employ these strengths strategically in both academic and professional contexts. The guidance on effectively utilizing GLASS funds and the insightful tips on creating an impactful e-portfolio have been instrumental in preparing me for future academic pursuits and career opportunities. These practical tools have empowered me to articulate my experiences and aspirations compellingly. Moreover, the connections forged and wisdom garnered from this program have established a robust foundation for my continued journey in healthcare and research, offering a solid grounding from which to explore and expand my professional horizons.


What I've enjoyed most about GLASS is the holistic approach it takes towards personal and professional development. Interacting with guest speakers, tackling assignments that challenge me to think critically about my strengths and goals, and the opportunity to research and network in fields that interest me have all been incredibly fulfilling. The program has not only broadened my academic horizons but has also instilled a greater sense of confidence and purpose in my path. I was given the opportunity to bond with others in GLASS throughout the semester and experience new things in New York City as we grew closer together as a cohort. The chance to collaborate with a diverse cohort, explore new perspectives, and continuously refine my research and leadership skills has made my experience in the GLASS program both enriching and inspiring.</p>
