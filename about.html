            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>I'm Fabiha, a senior at NYU Tandon studying Biomolecular Science with a minor in Public Policy and Management. As a <strong>GLASS (Global Leaders and Scholars in STEM) Scholar</strong>, I've spent the past three years exploring oral health inequity as a global challenge—shadowing dental providers in Sri Lanka and Kenya, conducting oral microbiome research at NYU Abu Dhabi, and working as a dental assistant in underserved New York communities.</p>

            <p>My work focuses on understanding how clinician training and systemic barriers influence treatment decisions, particularly the prioritization of extractions over restorative care in low-resource settings. I'm passionate about culturally competent, disability-inclusive dental care and the intersection of global health policy and clinical practice.</p>

            <p>Beyond research and clinical work, I serve as a <strong>GLASS Wellness Ambassador</strong>, <strong>Writing Partner</strong> at Tandon's Writing Center, and member of the <strong>Tandon Accessibility Team</strong>. I'm preparing to apply to dental school with the goal of becoming a clinician who addresses oral health disparities through patient-centered, equitable care.</p>

            <div class="mission-block">
              <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
              <p>I am deeply interested in advocating for equitable healthcare and dental care. As an aspiring pre-dental student, my goal is to strive for providing equitable resources. This interest stems from a realization of the disparities and accessibility issues prevalent in the healthcare system. I believe that everyone deserves quality healthcare and dental care, and through my education and future profession, I aim to contribute to narrowing this gap.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>My journey has always been intertwined with a deep-seated passion for healthcare and a relentless pursuit of knowledge and change. The trials I encountered in understanding complex biological processes and healthcare policies did not weaken my resolve but rather fueled my passion to bring about change in the healthcare field. This propelled me to seek opportunities beyond the traditional classroom setting, embarking on a quest for knowledge, reaching out to professionals in the field, and exploring various healthcare domains through extensive research.</p>

            <p>I've learned that to truly make an impact, one must understand healthcare from various angles – from the microscopic details of biomedical research to the broader implications of policy and management. My experiences, both in and out of the classroom, have significantly contributed to shaping my vision. I not only aspire to excel academically but also seek to understand and influence the many aspects of healthcare.</p>

            <p>Thanks to GLASS, I was able to learn so much more about the world and myself as a leader. Starting off the year studying abroad in Abu Dhabi, I was navigating through numerous challenges on my own in a way I had never considered before. I became more mindful of how I approach problems in my life, and this was in any scale from something even as little as figuring out which phone plan to purchase. Being in Abu Dhabi gave me the opportunity to immerse myself in another culture, and redefine who I am as an individual.</p>

            <h2>Beyond Academics</h2>
            <p>In my free time, I like to learn new languages through media exposure—whether it be through reading, watching TV shows/movies, or listening to music. I am currently learning Arabic, but have also been passively sharpening my skills in Korean and French. This approach allows me to naturally improve my listening and comprehension skills while also gaining insight into diverse perspectives and artistic expressions.</p>

            <p>Beyond language learning, I have a deep appreciation for creative expression. I enjoy writing, using it as a way to reflect on my experiences, explore different perspectives, and articulate my thoughts in meaningful ways. Additionally, I am currently learning pottery, which has been an exciting hands-on experience that allows me to blend artistry with craftsmanship. Whether through words or clay, I find fulfillment in creating and expressing myself in different forms.</p>

            <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
            <p>As I look toward the future, I see my path as one of continuous growth and significant contribution. I am committed to not only pursuing personal academic success but also to making a substantial impact in the world of healthcare. My ambition is to be at the forefront of innovative solutions, addressing complex health issues, and contributing to a future where quality healthcare is accessible and effective for all. With every step, I aim to draw closer to a world where healthcare is not just a privilege but a right available to every individual, regardless of their background or circumstances.</p>

          <div class="abstract-content">
            <p>Oral health inequity remains a persistent global challenge shaped by socioeconomic barriers, cultural perceptions of oral care, and clinician decision-making. Through my experiences as a GLASS Scholar shadowing dental providers in Sri Lanka and Kenya, as well as working as a dental assistant in a local New York clinic, I observed a recurring pattern: extraction-based care was often prioritized over restorative procedures, particularly in low-resource settings. These observations sparked my interest in understanding the structural, clinical, and educational determinants that drive such treatment decisions.</p>

            <p>This reflective research paper explores how practitioner training—particularly post-dental school workplace-based learning—influences treatment decision-making for restorative versus extraction-based care. Drawing on findings from the National Institute of Health's <em>Oral Health in America 2021</em> report, I examine how training sufficiency, clinical comfort, resource constraints, and cultural expectations shape the care offered to patients in both high- and low-resource environments.</p>

            <p>My three years in GLASS allowed me to engage deeply with this global challenge through multiple lenses: clinical observation, cross-cultural research, academic coursework in public policy and biomolecular science, and hands-on research at NYU Abu Dhabi's oral microbiome lab. I participated in GLASS programming focused on global health equity, served as a Wellness Ambassador, and facilitated discussions on disability-inclusive healthcare—experiences that shaped my understanding of how systemic inequities manifest in clinical spaces. My role as a research assistant at NYU Dentistry and my work in underserved New York communities further deepened my understanding of patient-centered care and clinical decision-making under real-world constraints.</p>

            <p>This paper synthesizes scholarly literature on dental workforce training, treatment planning frameworks, and global oral health trends with my reflections on witnessing these disparities firsthand. I analyze how differences in education systems, continuing education access, and financial structures between the U.S. and lower-resource countries contribute to divergent treatment philosophies.</p>

            <p>This paper ultimately seeks to provide insight into how global inequities in oral healthcare can be mitigated through improved practitioner training, context-specific continuing education, and targeted policy interventions in alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals—specifically SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities). By connecting my GLASS experiences to these frameworks, I aim to demonstrate how individual clinical encounters reflect broader patterns of structural injustice and how future clinicians can contribute to more equitable care delivery.</p>

              <h4>Connection to GLASS & Impact Areas</h4>
              <p>This work emerged directly from my three years as a GLASS Scholar exploring oral health inequity through the program's five windows. My global experiences in Sri Lanka, Kenya, and Japan, combined with leadership as a Wellness Ambassador, research at NYU Abu Dhabi's oral microbiome lab, clinical work in underserved New York communities, and coursework in public policy shaped my understanding of this challenge. This aligns with the <strong>Engineering Health</strong> impact area—applying interdisciplinary approaches to improve healthcare delivery and addressing systemic health disparities through workforce development and policy intervention.</p>
