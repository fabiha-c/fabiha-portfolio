        <h2>About GLASS Projects</h2>
        <p class="center">The projects for Tandon Honors students in the <a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/support-services/undergraduate/glass" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Leaders & Scholars in STEM</a> program consists of a culmination of various experiences, research, and interests related to the <a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/research/areas-excellence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tandon Areas of Research Excellence</a>. Scholars are also required to address the <a href="https://www.nae.edu/20782/grand-challenges-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NAE Grand Challenges</a> and think about the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United Nations Sustainability Development Goals</a> when doing so. At the end of the 3 years in the GLASS Program, students have a better understanding of the impact they can have on changing the world for the better. GLASS students enter the world as globally competent and socially responsible innovators and engineers!</p>

        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
        <p>I am deeply interested in advocating for equitable healthcare and dental care. As an aspiring pre-dental student, my goal is to strive for providing equitable resources. This interest stems from a realization of the disparities and accessibility issues prevalent in the healthcare system. I believe that everyone deserves quality healthcare and dental care, and through my education and future profession, I aim to contribute to narrowing this gap.</p>
        <p>To further my understanding and make an impact in this field, I've engaged in several initiatives. I've spoken with professionals about policymaking related to this topic and took a social impact class at the NYU Wagner Undergraduate School of Public Service to learn more about the mechanisms required to bring about large-scale change. My involvement in the GLASS program has allowed me to delve into research and networking opportunities in fields that interest me, honing my skills and deepening my knowledge about healthcare and dental care accessibility flaws. These efforts represent my commitment to learning and contributing to the healthcare sector, particularly in creating more equitable access to dental care.</p>
        <p>Thanks to GLASS, I was able to learn so much more about the world and myself as a leader this past year. Starting off the year studying abroad in Abu Dhabi, I was navigating through numerous challenges on my own in a way I had never considered before. I became more mindful of how I approach problems in my life, and this was in any scale from something even as little as figuring out which phone plan to purchase. Being in Abu Dhabi gave me the opportunity to immerse myself in another culture, and redefine who I am as an individual. Furthermore, I was able to learn so much from my peers who studied in Abu Dhabi, and am grateful I got to learn more about their cultures and passions as well. While in Abu Dhabi, I was also able to get involved in a wet lab for the first time, and I was taught many techniques that I hope to put use to in future research endeavors. This summer, I was also able to be so much more involved in numerous programs in France, Japan, and Sri Lanka. In France, I was involved in a program which focused on Artificial Intelligence training as well as a French Language and Cross-Cultural Communication track. In Japan, I attended the 22nd World Congress on Dental Traumatology. In Sri Lanka, I volunteered as part of a Prehealth service trip where I spent a week observing in a teaching hospital in Sri Lanka and spent the other week doing service work such as helping at a nursing home and feeding turtles at a turtle hatchery.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, I aim to gain more knowledge about the inherent flaws of the healthcare and dental care accessibility systems. I plan to continue my research and advocacy efforts, seeking innovative solutions and collaborations to address these challenges. The horizon holds potential for significant advancements in equitable healthcare, and I am committed to being a part of that change, using my education, research, and passion to make a lasting impact in the field.</p>

          <summary>Areas of Excellence</summary>
          <div class="body">
            <p>I aim to focus on the Health Area of Excellence, which is dedicated to engineering healthcare and life sciences, focusing on discovering new treatments, medical devices, and methods to deliver care. It aims to develop assistive technology to increase accessibility and improve global health outcomes, especially for underserved communities. The goals here are to make the population healthier through innovative engineering and partnerships with clinicians.</p>
            <p>My mission to advocate for equitable healthcare and dental care resonates deeply with the Health area of excellence. This area's commitment to discovering new treatments and improving delivery methods aligns with my goal of providing equitable healthcare resources. My focus on reaching underserved communities mirrors the area's emphasis on increasing accessibility and livability for all. As I aspire to contribute to a fairer healthcare system, the innovations and developments in this area provide a promising avenue for my ambitions.</p>
            <p>Think of the healthcare system as a complex machine that needs constant improvement to work better for everyone. The "Health" area of excellence is like a team of mechanics and inventors working tirelessly to find new ways to fix and upgrade this machine. They're not just fixing what's broken; they're inventing new parts to make the machine more efficient and accessible to everyone, no matter where they live or what resources they have.</p>
            <p>My mission is like joining this team with a special focus: I'm not only interested in making the machine work better but ensuring it works well for everyone, especially those who have been ignored or left behind in the past. By aligning with this area, I'm contributing to a future where healthcare is not just a privilege for the few but a basic right for all, ensuring the health and well-being of every individual is valued and protected.</p>

          <summary>UN Sustainability Development Goals / NAE Grand Challenges</summary>
          <div class="body">
            <p><strong>Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.</strong></p>
            <p>This goal focuses on a wide range of aspects crucial for a healthy life, from reducing maternal mortality and preventable diseases to achieving universal health coverage and reducing deaths from pollution. It resonates deeply with my mission to advocate for equitable healthcare and dental care, emphasizing the need for comprehensive, quality health services accessible to all individuals.</p>
            <p><strong>Goal 10: Reduce inequality within and among countries.</strong></p>
            <p>This goal aims to empower and promote social, economic, and political inclusion for all, regardless of various individual characteristics. It seeks to reduce inequalities of outcome and ensure equal opportunity by eliminating discriminatory practices and promoting appropriate legislation and policies. This aligns with my desire to create a healthcare system that is fair and accessible to all segments of the population, addressing disparities and advocating for equitable healthcare resource.</p>
            <p>These goals are central to my mission as they encapsulate the broader impact I wish to make in the healthcare sector. By working towards these goals, I aim to contribute to a world where health and well-being are prioritized, and where everyone, regardless of their background, has access to the care they need and the opportunity to lead a healthy life. These objectives not only reflect my aspirations but also guide my actions and research towards making a tangible difference in people's lives.</p>
